      <doc d_id="1">When is a person old? There are many individuals who still seem 'young' at seventy or more, while others appear 'old' in their fifties. From another point of view, sumo wrestlers, for instance, are 'old' in their thirties, whereas artists' best years may come in their sixties or even later. But in general, people are old when society considers them to be old, that is, when they retire from work at around the age of sixty or sixty-five. Nowadays, however, the demand for new work skills is making more and more individuals old before their time. Although older workers tend to be dependable, and have much to offer from their many years of experience, they are put at a disadvantage by rapid developments in technology. Older people usually find it more difficult to acquire the new skills required by technological changes, and they do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as young workers. When they finally leave work and retire, people face further problems. The majority receive little or no assistance in adjusting to their new situation in the community. Moreover, since society at present appears to have no clear picture of what place its older members should occupy, it is unable to offer them enough opportunities to have satisfying social roles after they retire. In the past, the old used to be looked upon as experts in solving various problems of life. Today, however, they are no longer regarded as such and are seldom expected to play significant roles in social, economic and community affairs. With the number of older people in the population rapidly increasing, we need greatly to increase and improve the opportunities provided for them so that they can participate in society with dignity and respect.  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">It began when I was a 16-year-old high school student. I was reading a popular youth magazine when I noticed a list of addresses of young people from all over the world who were seeking pen pals in Japan. I had often seen boys and girls in my class receiving fat airmail envelopes from overseas. Having a pen pal was the fashion of the day. Why shouldn't I get one, too? So I picked out the address of one &quot;Margaret K.&quot; in Boston and, remembering that a girl from my class had once told me young ladies like to read letters on pink paper, I went out to buy some. &quot;Dear Pen Pal,&quot; I began, but then stopped. I was very nervous and really didn't know how to continue or what to say. After much effort I finished the letter, though it didn't even fill one page. The reply from faraway America came sooner than I had expected. &quot;I was surprised to receive your letter,&quot; Margaret wrote. &quot;I don't know how my address got into a magazine in Japan, because I have never asked for a pen pal, but it's so nice hearing from someone in such a fascinating country, and I look forward to corresponding with you.&quot; I don't know how many times I read that letter. When writing to Margaret, I took care not to say anything that might upset her. While English came naturally to Margaret, for me it was a foreign language, so I wrote only about everyday matters. But somewhere in my heart there was a sense of romance which I dared not express. For her part, though Margaret wrote long letters, she revealed little about herself. Big envelopes containing books, magazines, and other small gifts began to arrive. I had no doubt that Margaret was a rich American girl, and that she was as beautiful as her attractive gifts. I felt that our pen friendship was a great success. However, there was one thing I couldn't get out of my mind. I knew it would be impolite to ask a girl her age, but thought it would be all right to ask her to send a picture. So I wrote the request and at last came the reply. Margaret said simply that she had no suitable pictures of herself at that time, but that she would send me one someday. She added that &quot;the average American girl&quot; was much nicer-looking than she was. Years went by. Our letters became less frequent but we never lost touch. Meanwhile, I graduated from college, got a job, married and had children. I still hoped that I might be able to meet Margaret someday and that my family might also meet her. Then, one day I received a large airmail envelope addressed in unfamiliar handwriting. It contained a few magazines and a note from a lady named Alice. &quot;I'm very sorry to inform you,&quot; the note said, &quot;that Margaret died in an accident last month while she was driving home from church. We had been close friends for the past sixty years - ever since we were in high school together. Margaret often mentioned how happy she was to hear from you. Though she lived alone, she had many friends, and always tried to help others, both far and near.&quot; There was also a photograph enclosed. Margaret had asked her friend to send it only in the case of her death. The face in the picture was one of great beauty and kindness. It was a face I would have loved even when I was still young and she was already quite old.  fs</doc>

      <doc d_id="1">Do animals play? Certainly, many animals, especially the young, engage in behavior that seems like play. But why do they play? This question is difficult to answer, even for experts. For one thing, there are considerable difficulties involved in observing animals at play when they are not in natural surroundings. Monkeys, for example, play a lot in the wild, but in cages it is hard to make them play when you want them to. You have to sit patiently, waiting for the right moments. And even when you do see them playing, it is still difficult to say why they are doing so. Scientists have noticed that when two monkeys are 'play-fighting,' they take turns winning. One will be on top, and it will look as if he is winning. Then suddenly he will give the other a chance to take control of the action. It is believed that this kind of play helps monkeys learn to take different roles when they are older. Like humans, animals sometimes need to take charge, and sometimes follow. Monkeys seem to learn this lesson by playing. Another likely purpose of play is to let animals learn how to get along with others of their own age. It has been found that while baby rats kept with their brothers and sisters engage in a lot of rough play, those raised alone with their mothers play just a little. However, when rats which have only been with their mothers are put with other young rats, they play a lot more than those brought up in a large family. It seems that they make up for lost time . Though much remains to be discovered about animal play, studies like these do seem to indicate that animals learn some very basic skills by taking part in play-like activities.  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">People have trouble deciding what I am. Mexicans mistake me for Mexican; in Chinese restaurants I am usually given a menu written in Chinese; and once a Japanese boy asked me if I was Korean. Take the man I met at a barber's in Chicago, for instance. He was last in line waiting for a haircut, and he stared at me through his thick glasses as I walked in and sat next to him. Then he smiled and said in an accent that convinced me he was from Alabama, &quot;You're Indian, aren't you?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I told him, &quot;I'm not.&quot; Alabama shook his head and said, &quot;You can't fool me. I've met all kinds of American Indians. I know you're some kind of Indian.&quot; I took a deep breath. &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Cherokee?&quot; &quot;No, not Cherokee.&quot; &quot;Not Apache, are you?&quot; &quot;No. I've never even been in Apache country.&quot; There was a brief pause. He seemed to be trying to think of another Indian name. &quot;Winnebago?&quot; As it happened, I knew quite a lot about the Winnebagos. In the army I'd been friendly with a Winnebago Indian. He often talked to me about his home in Wisconsin. &quot;That's wonderful country where the Winnebagos live,&quot; I said. &quot;Plenty of fishing. Have you ever heard of muskellunge? Most people call them 'muskies'. They're really good to eat - salted, fried or broiled.&quot; Alabama looked impressed. &quot;So you're a Winnebago,&quot; he said happily. &quot;I never said that,&quot; I answered, and turned away. He lowered his voice. &quot;Are you running away from there? Maybe from the police?&quot; &quot;No, I am not,&quot; I responded sharply. &quot;OK, Chief,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;I didn't mean any harm.&quot; For a long time Alabama said nothing. Then he began again. &quot;Are you Comanche?&quot; &quot;No, I'm not Comanche,&quot; I said rather crossly, although I had nothing against the tribe. He thought hard. &quot;Hopi, then?&quot; I smiled. The Hopis were a tribe I'd be proud to belong to. I'd once gone to art school in Los Angeles with a Hopi. He was a fine artist. I started thinking about some of the great times we'd had together, and began to laugh. Alabama slapped his knee and said, &quot;You're a Hopi! From Arizona.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I was in Hopi country.&quot; I really had been there. I'd been sent to a special camp in Arizona for Japanese-Americans during World War II, before I joined the army. Alabama's eyes lit up. &quot;I knew it! What tribe was it, Chief?&quot; &quot;Nipponese. We were scattered a bit until the government gathered us up and put us all together again.&quot; Alabama nodded. &quot;That must be a very small tribe. I've never heard of it.&quot; I had enjoyed my joke, but I wasn't going to be anyone else but myself. &quot;A Nipponese is a Japanese,&quot; I said slowly and somewhat self-consciously. Alabama looked puzzled. &quot;Japanese, eh? You could pass as Indian any day.&quot; &quot;Japanese,&quot; I repeated. &quot;Sure, sure. But you were born in the USA, weren't you?&quot; &quot;I was born in Hawaii.&quot; &quot;Well, you're American like me, then. A man should be proud of what he is. Aren't you?&quot; &quot;I'm pleased that I am who I am, Alabama,&quot; I told him. &quot;It's good to be alive.&quot; &quot;Of course it is,&quot; he answered. &quot;But you're wrong about me. I'm not from Alabama.&quot; &quot;No?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; He stood up because it was finally his turn for a haircut. &quot;I'm from Georgia,&quot; he said in a loud voice, &quot;and proud of it.&quot; &quot;Sorry I made the mistake,&quot; I told him, though I just couldn't see what difference it made whether he came from Georgia or Alabama. </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">We survive by controlling our environment, and control is made possible by information. If we lack this, we feel insecure and come to feel that any knowledge is better than none. In an experiment, white rats repeatedly had to choose path A or path B. They always had a 50% chance of finding food in a box at the end of each path. But on path B, just before the box, there was a signal indicating whether or not food was present. After some days of training, all the rats developed a preference for path B, the side where they obtained information. Humans show the same sort of preference for knowledge about an outcome which is uncertain but unavoidable. Our anxiety about the future can be so great that bad news is preferable to an absence of information. Regardless of the nature of the news, and in spite of the fact that we get no advantage from it, we would prefer to know and thus reduce our insecurity. There can hardly be a more inaccurate saying than &quot;No news is good news.&quot; And yet people do not always demand a state of complete certainty. Indeed much of our success as human beings is based on our ability to cope with environmental changes and our tendency to seek out new and challenging experiences. The popularity of pastimes such as mountaineering and motor racing is evidence of man's need for some uncertainty and risk. Nevertheless, when these reach too high a level, we once more desire to have information about the future and a feeling of control over it.  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">My son and I were trying to sell the house we had restored but in the barn attached to it there were bats and they wouldn't leave. The barn was their home. They told us so in their own way. They hung there in the barn and seemed determined to stay for the season. If we knocked lightly on the outside, muttering sounds would follow, as if the bats were angry. They seemed to be asking us to stop bothering them and not to replace that pane in the window through which they flew in and out. &quot;Don't worry about it, Dad,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;They keep down the mosquitoes.&quot; Unfortunately they also kept the buyers away. When we had asked a person to sell the house for us he had refused to show it because of the bats. In truth, I sympathized. Who would want to share space with the cousins of Dracula? &quot;Bats are popular,&quot; Patrick assured me. &quot;They're ecological.&quot; &quot;Isn't there a machine you can buy that produces high-frequency sounds to keep bats away?&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Patrick. &quot;But I like bats, and whoever buys this house will probably like them too.&quot; &quot;Probably?&quot; I hated that word. &quot;How many bats are there, anyway?&quot; &quot;I counted about 90 last night,&quot; said Patrick. &quot;They were dropping out from under the edge of the roof.&quot; &quot;You mean there are more - outside?&quot; &quot;They're everywhere, Dad. But look at it this way. When the cold weather comes, they'll be off to Mexico. Maybe in the spring we can seal them out. Don't worry about it,&quot; he said for the hundredth time. &quot;It's not a problem.&quot; The bat expert I called was even more enthusiastic than Patrick. &quot;I think you've got a large number there,&quot; he said in wonder. &quot;I've been trying to attract bats to our house for 25 years! A single bat eats up his weight in mosquitoes and black flies three times every night. He flies in and out, eats, digests, and goes out for more. You're a very lucky man.&quot; I offered to share my luck with him. He could take them away. &quot;Bats have a remarkable homing instinct,&quot; he said. &quot;They'd fly straight back even if I transported them 100 miles. Once they have settled, you can't stop them from coming back.&quot; I was silent. As if to reassure me, he continued, &quot;You may have one of the few groups of bats left around here. They're in danger of dying out.&quot; Once more he said, &quot;You're a lucky man.&quot; I was not sure whether to take pride in my good fortune. If a possible buyer, noticing the barn floor dirty with bat droppings, said, &quot;Oh, I see you have mice,&quot; I would just smile and nod my head. I might have said, &quot;Actually, those are from the bats. We're lucky, you know. We've got a large group of bats. Right here. Thousands of them. More every year, and they keep coming back. They are of great value. Each one eats about a thousand insects a night. I'll show you some. The babies are really cute.&quot; I might have said all that, but who would be listening? Finally we managed to rent the house to a young family, who were also interested in buying it. &quot;What about the bats?&quot; I said to Patrick. &quot;Oh, they love the bats,&quot; he said. &quot;No mosquitoes. No black flies. It's one of the things that attracted them.&quot; &quot;Do you think they will really buy the house?&quot; &quot;Probably.&quot; &quot;Probably? Well, if they do, I suppose I'll have to admit that I was wrong.&quot; &quot;You mean you're going to eat your words?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">When people travel abroad they are immediately struck by the many different ways in which buildings, homes and cities are designed. A group of Americans staying in a South American country reacted emotionally to the unfamiliar architectural surroundings which they found there. The Latin-American house is often built around a small open area, a patio, which is next to the sidewalk but hidden from outsiders behind a wall. Such relatively small differences in the buildings can affect foreigners to a surprising degree. These Americans complained that they felt cut off from local people and their lives and kept wondering what was going on &quot;behind those walls.&quot; The division of space inside homes may also vary from one culture to another. Most American homes contain rooms such as bedrooms, a living room and a dining room whose layout reveals the separation and naming of space according to function. This system is in sharp contrast to other cultures where one room in a house may be used for several purposes. In Japan, homes have removable sliding doors so that two small rooms can be converted into one large room, and a living room can also serve as a bedroom. When a home or a city's design is influenced by another culture, not only the native architecture but together with it the social pattern can be lost or affected. A French architect, for example, planned a new city in India with centralized shopping areas which required movement by public transportation away from the traditional village centers. The result was that the Indians stopped meeting each other socially in their own local communities. It has been said that &quot;we shape our buildings and they shape us.&quot; The Indian example seems to demonstrate this.  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">Tom Jackson was my school friend, and he and his sister Jenny lived in a tall, old, broken-down house which their parents had bought for practically nothing because it was said to be haunted by a ghost. Rumour had it that a woman had hanged herself by her own hair from the ceiling of the attic room above Tom's bedroom, and that she kept revisiting the scene of the tragedy. Tom said he had heard strange noises overhead while he'd been in his bedroom making a model aeroplane. Jenny said it was nonsense and he'd been watching too many Late Night Horror Shows on TV, but it gave us an idea for tricking George, a friend of ours. We would invite him to the Jacksons' one afternoon, get him up to the attic and haunt him there. We were to tell him we would have tea in the attic, away from the grown-ups, and I was to take him there while the others pretended to be fetching the food from the kitchen. In fact, Tom would go to the cellar where the main switches were, and, at the right moment, would throw the attic into darkness. Jenny would be hiding in the attic, and when the lights went out she would creep onto a chest of drawers. She would shine an electric torch with green and red filters onto her face, which would thus appear to be floating horribly in midair. What's more, Jenny had long hair just like the woman in the story. We worked out how long it would take for George and me to reach the attic and sit down with George facing the chest of drawers. After another half-minute, I would make some excuse and go out of the room where I could hold the door shut in case George tried to flee from the terror. We rehearsed our parts carefully. Eventually the time came for the haunting. &quot;I'll go and see about some tea,&quot; said Jenny and went off, apparently towards the kitchen, where Mrs. Jackson was making sandwiches and baking cakes. A couple of minutes later, as arranged, Tom suggested that we all go upstairs for our private picnic, and I led George along while Tom slipped off &quot;to help in the kitchen.&quot; The plan worked perfectly. George and I climbed to the attic and settled down in the appointed positions. Then I wandered out of the room &quot;to see where everyone was.&quot; Just as I closed the door behind me, Tom threw the switch and everything went black. The event was alarming, but I hung onto the door handle and tried to hear what was happening through the keyhole. There was a creak, which suggested that George had jumped to his feet, but he didn't seem to be moving about, or responding to Jenny, who, by now, must have been starting her torch trick. Then suddenly and quite unexpectedly there came screams and shrieks and sobbing from inside. I pushed open the door to find out what was going on. At the same instant, the lights came on again and I saw poor George flat on his back on the floor. His face was pale and he was trembling and kept mumbling, &quot;The face... the face....&quot; &quot;Don't be stupid, George,&quot; I said, &quot;it's only Jenny.&quot; As I looked round for Jenny, there was a great noise on the stairs and Mrs. Jackson burst in and shouted angrily, &quot;What's going on here? We nearly spilt boiling water over ourselves.&quot; And there behind her, white-faced and stunned, straight from the kitchen - where she had been told to stay and help make the tea - was Jenny!  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">&quot;We're going,&quot; Mimi called out to her mother in the family's grocery store next to her house. This was her first date, and Robert Rovere had just arrived to take her to a dance. She could hardly believe it was happening. During the long wait she had wondered again and again what to wear, finally putting on her favorite blouse. Now at last Robert was here. He looked beautiful to her. His hair was neatly combed and he wore a yellow sweater she hadn't seen before. Mimi felt wonderful. As they stepped out of the door, Mimi's mother popped out of the store and said hello to Robert. Then she put a package wrapped in white paper into Mimi's hand. &quot;Limburger cheese for Sally Thompson, Mimi. We got a case of imported Limburger in today. I promised Sally you'd deliver it tonight.&quot; &quot;Tonight!&quot; Mimi echoed, staring down at the cheese. &quot;Why not tomorrow?&quot; &quot;Sorry, but I promised Sally,&quot; her mother said. &quot;Well, have fun you two.&quot; &quot;Oh well. Robert, let's go,&quot; she said. Her first date ever, her first date with Robert Rovere, and she was stuck with a large, smelly, messy package of cheese! She tried to forget it. Here I am, she said to herself, going to a dance with Robert Rovere. She glanced up at him. &quot;That cheese smells,&quot; he said. She held the cheese in the hand farthest from him, but the smell seemed to be crawling up her arm. They turned onto Montcalm Street. Mimi didn't know the house number, but she thought she'd recognize the house because she'd passed there once before. &quot;Oh, here it is.&quot; She rang the bell but nobody answered. Then she noticed that the name under the bell wasn't Thompson. She had come to the wrong house. Oh, how embarrassing, she thought. She dropped the cheese into her coat pocket and rejoined Robert. &quot;Wrong house,&quot; she said. &quot;I was sure she lived there.&quot; &quot;What do we do now?&quot; Robert asked. Mimi bit her lip. She couldn't bring the cheese home again now. It would just have to go to the dance with her. &quot;Let's go,&quot; she said. She was so miserable she couldn't think of another thing to say, and she and Robert walked the rest of the way in a silence as thick as the bad smell of the cheese. When they arrived at the dance, the place was full of people and there was no room to hang their coats. Mimi wanted to wash her hands, but Robert led her straight onto the dance floor. Mimi noticed that Robert smelled sweet, like lily of the valley. She smelled of Limburger cheese. Mimi danced with all her heart. Robert's eyes were closed. Probably trying to forget her and her smell, she thought. After a while they went to the snack bar. As they enjoyed their drinks, Robert stared over Mimi's head. He's bored, she thought. Well, the evening was a disaster. The strong smell rising from her pocket was growing stronger by the moment. A redheaded boy stopped to talk to Robert. &quot;Who took off their shoes here?&quot; the boy asked. Mimi's heart sank. &quot;Something smells,&quot; said the redheaded boy. Mimi held her breath. She couldn't look at Robert. &quot;I don't smell a thing,&quot; Robert said. &quot;Do you, Mimi?&quot; For a moment she thought she'd heard wrong. Robert was smiling at her in a special way. She stared at him in astonishment. &quot;No. I don't smell anything,&quot; she managed to say. &quot;Must be your imagination,&quot; Robert said to the boy. Mimi couldn't believe her ears. Then she burst out laughing. How about that! Robert was sticking up for her. It was wonderful. The cheese had suddenly become their secret. When Mimi and Robert left the dance, the streets were quiet. They walked close together, humming one of the songs they'd danced to. The moon was high now, sliced thin, riding like a cheerful boat above them. &quot;I'm sorry about the cheese,&quot; Mimi said. &quot;Cheese?&quot; smiled Robert. &quot;What cheese?&quot;  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1">Mrs. Tortino lived in an old Victorian house crowded all around by tall, new buildings, fifteen, twenty stories high. The house had been her family's for many years, and Mrs. Tortino was determined never to leave it. But life had become difficult. The tall buildings made her old house dark, so that Mrs. Tortino saw little of the sun every day. The darkness made her garden damp and unhealthy. Her vegetables grew weaker and the flowers wouldn't bloom. Even the chestnut tree looked sad. Then there was the traffic. Its noise never ended, and Mrs. Tortino's old cat, Pursifur, coughed a lot because of the terrible air. He spent his time on the roof, where the air was fresher and the sun was a little closer. Yet in spite of everything, Mrs. Tortino would not move from the house. She remembered how just last year some people had come with money to buy it, so they could tear it down and construct another tall building in its place. But Mrs. Tortino had sent them away with angry words. Then one day in early spring, a man in a bowler hat came to her door. Somehow he seemed different from the others as he walked all around her shaded house, gazing at the long shadows in the garden and sniffing the foul air. At first Mrs. Tortino thought he would offer her money for her home, like all the rest of the men. But when he began to speak she listened, her eyes opening wide. &quot;Could you really do that?&quot; she asked. The man nodded. &quot;A tall building right where my house stands, but you won't destroy....?&quot; &quot;That's right&quot; he said. &quot;Your house will be under the same sky, on the same street, at the same address. You'll keep everything just as it is. Even Pursifur.&quot; &quot;And there will be money for more tomato plants and some flower seeds and cat food for Pursifur?&quot; &quot;Indeed,&quot; said the man, smiling. Mrs. Tortino stared at the man in the bowler hat for a long time. Then, at last, she said, &quot;All right!&quot; And they shook hands. When he had gone, Mrs. Tortino looked down at Pursifur. &quot;Isn't it amazing?&quot; she said. &quot;I can hardly believe it's possible!&quot; Pursifur just hummed quietly. Soon workers came with their tractors and their cranes. They lifted Mrs. Tortino's old house right off the ground and set it to one side. Then they dug up the garden very carefully and replanted it all in pots. Everything was now ready, and the construction of the building could start. After five weeks, a strong steel frame had been built, two stories high. On top of the frame stood a crane, and next to the crane stood Mrs. Tortino's family home. Every week, as a new floor was finished, Mrs. Tortino's house was lifted one floor higher. Each time it rose, the sunshine increased, and Mrs. Tortino smiled broadly. By the twentieth week, Mrs. Tortino's house was seventeen stories off the ground, where it was sunny from five in the morning until nine at night. Mrs. Tortino hardly knew there were cars below, and Pursifur had forgotten about his cough. Mrs. Tortino recalled how at first she had been afraid in her bed when the great crane picked up her old home. Then she had taken to looking out of the window. At last she simply sat down on the front porch and enjoyed the ride as her house was lifted higher in the sky. It was like being on the Big Wheel in an amusement park. Then at last, in another three months, the new building was finished. It was the tallest in the city - thirty floors. People looking up from below saw a house on top of the building. Others looked through powerful glasses and saw pumpkins, tomatoes, and lettuce. &quot;And isn't that a chestnut tree?&quot; someone said. Certainly there was a chestnut tree, as well as some very large pumpkins. But it was not just any house they saw. It was Mrs. Tortino's old family home. </doc>

Why did they have to say things like that?  &quot;If only I could go back to Brazil,&quot; I thought. Memories of my early years filled my head. Playing, swimming, dancing, music, laughter.... When my parents decided to move to Japan, though, I had to leave all that behind. I was only seven years old at the time, but I still remember that day. &quot;Elena, we're going to Japan.&quot; &quot;For a holiday?&quot; I knew I had some distant relatives in Japan, although I'd never met them. It would be fun to fly in an airplane and visit them. &quot;No, to live. We're going to work there, and you'll be able to go to a new school and learn Japanese. Then you'll be able to go to a university there, and if you can speak two languages fluently when you grow up, you'll be able to get a good job in the future.&quot; &quot;I don't want to go to a new school. I like my school here. And what about my friends?&quot; &quot;Don't worry, Elena. You'll make new friends.&quot; I didn't want new friends. I wanted my old friends, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, and cousins in Brazil. But there was no arguing; it was decided and that was that. Two months later, we arrived in Japan. The first few months were hard because I didn't speak Japanese. However, my teachers and classmates were kind. I soon picked up the language and made friends and spent five happy years at elementary school. The problems began when I moved to junior high school. My junior high school accepts students from three different elementary schools, and I found myself in a class with many people I had never met before. Although I spoke Japanese fluently and my behavior was in no way different from anyone else's, two of my new classmates started to tease me after they heard me speaking Portuguese with my parents at the entrance ceremony. What hurt me most deeply was the question of when I was going back to Brazil. If I went back to school in Brazil, it would be so difficult to catch up with my former classmates there. Besides, all my friends were in Japan now. I'd spent half my life in Japan, and Japan was my home.  The two girls started again, &quot;When are you going back to Brazil?&quot; I wished they would stop. Then suddenly, I heard a voice behind me, &quot;Elena, what's the matter?&quot; Natsumi, Maiko, and Kaori were walking over to me. They had been my friends since my arrival in Japan. At first, we taught each other words in Japanese and Portuguese. After that, we always encouraged and helped each other. &quot;Oh, nothing. I'm just being asked again when I'm going back to Brazil.&quot; Natsumi turned angrily toward the two girls who were teasing me. &quot;Don't you understand? You have only one culture, but Elena has two. OK, that makes her different, but aren't we all different?&quot; Maiko joined in, saying to the two girls, &quot;You're both different from me, but that's not a bad thing. I'm certainly not nasty to you because of it.&quot; The two girls looked ashamed. After a few moments of tense silence, they walked off toward the classroom. As I saw them walking away, the anger inside me overflowed, &quot;I hate it! I hate it!&quot; Natsumi put her hand on my shoulder, as if to calm me. &quot;Elena, they just don't understand yet. They'll realize eventually.&quot; &quot;Natsumi's right,&quot; added Kaori. &quot;I know that sometimes being Brazilian and Japanese makes things difficult for you, but it also makes you special.&quot; &quot;Yes, that's something to be proud of,&quot; said Maiko. My friends were right. Deep inside, I knew that they were right. I looked at them with gratitude and finally let the tears fall.  </doc>

      <doc d_id="1"> George was a piano tuner. As he walked along the street, his head was held high and his eyes were smiling. He whistled softly to himself, a constant stream of thoughts running through his mind. He was a tall, thin man who was always cheerful. No matter how busy he was, he always made time to talk to other people, even if it was only a few words of greeting. In his right hand he carried a heavy, square, painted toolbox. As the sun set behind the hills and George marched down the middle of the street, he came across a child sitting on the edge of the road. &quot;Are you a carpenter, sir?&quot; the boy asked, looking up at the old man's face. George stopped and turned toward the boy to answer. &quot;No, I'm not a carpenter.&quot; &quot;But you've got a carpenter's toolbox.&quot; George smiled at the boy. &quot;It looks like a carpenter's toolbox, doesn't it? But I don't make things out of wood. I'm a piano tuner. If you look inside this box, you'll see that the contents are completely different. Do you want to see?&quot; &quot;Yes, please.&quot; George sat down on the sidewalk and opened the box. The boy sat down beside him. He was very interested in the contents of the box and asked many questions: &quot;What does a piano tuner do?&quot; &quot;What's this for?&quot; &quot;How does this work?&quot; George answered all the child's questions in great detail. He described how the piano worked, with its little hammers striking the strings to produce sounds. He told stories about famous pianists and their lives. He hummed well-known parts of classical music and tapped out different rhythms on his box. He tried to teach the boy the notes of the scale using a piece of stone on the sidewalk. His explanations and gestures thrilled the boy and made him laugh. The two sat side by side on the sidewalk. George had his long legs drawn up to his chin and was waving his arms as he explained things to the boy. The boy was listening to the man with all his attention, his eyes wide open and curious. Neither the man nor the boy paid any attention to what was happening around them in the street. They were clearly enjoying each other's company, and everybody who walked past them smiled to see such a happy pair. Then George looked into his box again and took out a small flute. He lifted it to his mouth and played a short, soft tune, and the birds in the nearby trees sang back joyfully. The boy watched with admiration, and then George handed him the flute. &quot;Do you want to try?&quot; &quot;I don't know how to play it.&quot; &quot;Just try. Like this....&quot; George showed the boy where to place his fingers and how to make the sounds. The boy tried. He could not play well at first, but he kept trying and was excited when he started to produce the right notes. &quot;You see,&quot; said George with a broad smile. &quot;You can do it!&quot; The look of pure delight in the boy's eyes encouraged George to continue. &quot;You can keep the flute if you like.&quot; &quot;Really, sir? Really? Oh, thank you.&quot; Time passed quickly and it was soon time to say good-bye. The young boy, his face glowing with happiness, spoke up in a loud voice. &quot;When I grow up, I'm going to be like you.&quot; The piano tuner put his hand on the child's head. He felt proud and satisfied that he had managed to give the boy such a good impression of his job. &quot;Then you're going to be a piano tuner?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the little boy confidently, &quot;I'm going to talk with children.&quot;  </doc>
